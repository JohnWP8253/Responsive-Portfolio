        <p>I'm a communications training developer in the BPO industry and I currently design training
            programs for
            customer service trainees, agents, and their leaders. On the side, I am also an English as a Second
            Language teacher and I have over 24 years experience. In that time, I was a director of studies
            for
            English First.</p>

        <p>Teaching English opened so many doors for me as I traveled the world working. I worked in Warsaw,
            Poland
            for 6 years, Casablanca, Morocco for two, and Surabaya, Indonesia for 8. It turned me into a
            polyglot which lends itself to coding. Those 16 years molded me
            into
            the person I am today and I am ever greatful for the experience. </p>

        <p>I've chosen to get into coding as I am a very creative individual and seeing the endless
            posibilities,
            I'm very excited to get started.</p>
